/*
   This file is used as the root export of this package.

   Since react-native is removing haste as a module lookup mechanism,
   we need to re-export the whole of react-native from react-native-win32.

   We also export the things that are actually exposed to users as part of react-native-win32.
   Following how react-native exports everything, we export using inline requires
   to support the inline require optimizations that the various react-native bundlers use.

   NOTE: when adding exports here, they should also be added to the `typings-index.ts` file,
         which will provide proper type information for these exports.
