## IViewWin32Props.onFocusCapture property

The onFocus event occurs when an element gets focus. The opposite of onFocus is onBlur. Note that in React Native, unlike in the web, the onFocus event bubbles (similar to onFocusIn in the web).

`ev.target === ev.currentTarget` when the focus is being lost from this component. `ev.target !== ev.currentTarget` when the focus is being lost from a descendant.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
onFocusCapture?: (ev: RN.NativeSyntheticEvent<{}>) => void;
```
