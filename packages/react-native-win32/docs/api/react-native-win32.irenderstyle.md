## IRenderStyle type

An IRenderStyle describes style as a function that takes the current state of the parent component. It is up to the parent to invoke the function and make proper use of the more typical StyleProp<S> object that is returned This is convenient for when styles need to be calculated depending on interaction states.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type IRenderStyle<T, S> = (state: T) => StyleProp<S>;
```
