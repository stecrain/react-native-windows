## IRenderChild type

An IRenderChild describes children as a function that take the current state of the parent component. It is up to the parent to invoke the function and make proper use of the more typical ReactNode object that is returned This is an especially helpful construct when children of a Touchable require knowledge of the interaction state of their parent to properly render themselves (e.g. foreground color of a text child)

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type IRenderChild<T> = IChildAsFunction<T> | React.ReactNode;
```
