# Getting Started Guide for React Native Windows (vnext)

This is a summary of setup steps needed to install and work with React Native for Windows (vnext). See the [React Native Getting Started Guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for React Native details and see [Getting Started Guide - current](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/current/docs/GettingStarted.md) for working with the `current` React Native for Windows implementation.

## System Requirements
* You can run React-Native for Windows10 apps only on Windows 10 devices and Windows version: 10.0.15063.0 or higher. See [Windows 10 Compatability](./win10compat.md) for version support details.
  * Ensure Developer Mode is turned ON in Windows Settings App. 
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads) with the following options:
  * Workloads
    * Universal Windows Platform development
      * Enable the optional `C++ (v141) Universal Windows Platform tools`
    * Desktop development with C++
  * Individual Components
    * Compilers, build tools and runtimes
      * MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)
      * MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ ARM build tools (v14.16)
    * Development activities
      * Node.js development support (optional)

## Dependencies
* Install the dependencies [specified by React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#node-python2-jdk). Specifically, make sure a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is the React Native recommended installation method. But you can also install Node directly from [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  To use chocolately, from an elevated Command Prompt, run:
  ```
  choco install nodejs.install --version=12.9.1
  ```
* Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (*optional*, but needed for JS debugging)
* Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (*optional* if consuming react-native-windows, but required to work in the react-native-windows repo)

## Installing React Native for Windows (vnext)
There are two ways to install and work with React Native for Windows (vnext):
1. [Consuming react-native-windows](./ConsumingRNW.md) : Using react-native-windows in your package
1. [Building react-native-windows repo](./BuildingRNW.md) : Manually by cloning the repo and get things running.

## E2E Test
Please refer to [Author and Run E2E Test for React Native Windows](E2ETest.md)

# Troubleshooting
* If after running the app, the packager does not update (or) app does not show React Native content - close the packager command prompt window and the app, make sure browser is open, run `yarn start` and run the app from Visual Studio again.  
* If you get a red error box in your UWP app window with the error message : `ERROR: Instance failed to start. A connection with the server cannot be established`, make sure you have the packager running using `yarn start` and run the app again.
