# Component & Module API Parity Status
This doc reports the status progress of core components modules/APIs integration for vnext. The high priority components and modules tracked here will be in alignment with the [React Native Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) effort, others not in Lean Core we plan on shipping as separate packages in [Milestone 3](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/milestone/17).

If there is a discrepency here, or features are not being tracked that should be, please [submit an issue under vnext](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new?labels=vnext&template=vnext.md) to let us know.

We are making steady progress in this workstream and will be investing more in [Milestone 3](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/milestone/17) with a goal to get to complete feature parity on lean-core components before EOY 2019. You can keep track of the progress here through the [Core Feature Parity project](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/7).

### Components

## Packages to be Refactored Separately
These set of components and modules are not part of [React Native Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) and hence will be moved into separate packages in React Native for Windows.
